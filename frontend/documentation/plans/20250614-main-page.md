# Plan: Main Page Frontend

**Objective:** To create a compelling and intuitive frontend for the plugin's main page, which will serve as the user's primary interaction point for delegating tasks to different AI agents (referred to as "interns").

## 1. Overview

The main page will be displayed in a side panel. It will feature a list of available "interns" that the user can interact with. The initial version will provide simple navigation to relevant web pages, setting the foundation for more complex interactions in the future.

## 2. Phases of Development

### Phase 1: Foundational Scaffolding

- **Goal:** Establish the basic structure for the main page and its components.
- **Tasks:**
    - [x] Create a new view for the main page.
    - [x] Develop placeholder components for the list of interns and individual list items.
    - [x] Set up the basic layout using Material-UI components.

### Phase 2: Static Implementation

- **Goal:** Implement the static version of the main page with the initial set of interns.
- **Tasks:**
    - Populate the list with the three initial interns: "Email Assistant", "LinkedIn Connector", and "CRM Agent".
    - Implement navigation for the "Email Assistant" (to `gmail.com`) and "LinkedIn Connector" (to `linkedin.com`). The "CRM Agent" will be a non-interactive placeholder for now.
    - Style the components to be visually appealing and consistent with the overall plugin design.

### Phase 3: Future-Proofing and Integration

- **Goal:** Prepare the codebase for future dynamic functionality.
- **Tasks:**
    - Define a clear data structure (e.g., a TypeScript interface) for an intern, including properties like `name`, `id`, `description`, `icon`, and `targetUrl`.
    - Structure the components to easily consume a list of interns from a data source (e.g., a static array in this phase, potentially an API call in the future).
    - No implementation of dynamic data fetching in this plan, but the component structure should support it.

## 3. Component Breakdown

The new components will be located in `src/sidepanel/views/main-page/`.

### `MainPage.tsx`
- **Location:** `src/sidepanel/views/main-page/MainPage.tsx`
- **Responsibility:** The main container for the view. It will manage the state for the list of interns and render the `InternsList` component.

### `InternsList.tsx`
- **Location:** `src/sidepanel/views/main-page/components/InternsList.tsx`
- **Responsibility:** Renders a list of interns using Material-UI's `<List>` component. It will map over the interns' data and render an `InternListItem` for each.

### `InternListItem.tsx`
- **Location:** `src/sidepanel/views/main-page/components/InternListItem.tsx`
- **Responsibility:** Represents a single intern in the list. It will use Material-UI's `<ListItem>`, `<ListItemButton>`, `<ListItemIcon>`, and `<ListItemText>`. It will handle the click event for navigation.

## 4. Proposed File Structure

```
src/
├── sidepanel/
│   ├── views/
│   │   ├── main-page/
│   │   │   ├── MainPage.tsx
│   │   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   │   ├── InternsList.tsx
│   │   │   │   └── InternListItem.tsx
│   ├── Sidepanel.tsx  // This will be modified to render MainPage
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## 5. Integrations

- **UI Framework:** React with Material-UI (`@mui/material`) will be used for all UI components to ensure a consistent and modern look and feel.
- **Navigation:** For external links, we will use standard HTML `<a>` tags within the `ListItemButton` component to open new tabs. No internal routing library is needed for this phase.

This plan provides a clear path to building a robust and scalable main page for the plugin.
